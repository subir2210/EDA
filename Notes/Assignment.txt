Assignment-1 : Design a Stats Model for Hypothesis Designing.
(a) Model should be able to tackle the Z-Distributions
(b) Model should be able to tackle the t-Distributions
(c) Model should be able to tackle the Population Proportions along with the sample mean Analysis.

Print the final outputs in terms of Hypothesis Rejected or Accepted. Make use of flags to find out the Z or T distributions. Similarly use the flags for the Population Proportions.

Assignment : Study & explore the differences between the Variance and Standard Deviation in terms of Analytics & Data Science.
