1. EDA

Find patterns in data through data visualization. Reveal hidden secrets of the data through graphs, analysis and charts.

Univariate analysis
                   Continous variables :  Histograms, boxplots. This gives us understanding about the central tendency and spread
				   Categorical variable : Bar chart showing frequency in each category
Bivariate analysis
				   Continous & Continous : Scatter plots to know how continous variables interact with each other
                   Categorical & categorical : Stacked column chart to show how the frequencies are spread between two
                   Categorical variables
                   Categorical & Continous : Boxplots, Swamplots or even bar charts
Detect outliers
Feature engineering


Numerical variables with histograms,
Categorical variables with count plots,

Relationships between numerical variables with scatter plots, joint plots, and pair plots, and
Relationships between numerical and categorical variables with box-and-whisker plots and complex conditional plots.

Drop Columns\Rows Techniques

1. Drop column if 40% of missing values
2. Drop column if duplicate value ( unique )
3. Drop column if zero variance ( Numerical data )
4. Drop column if it's highly corelated
5. Drop rows if outliers
